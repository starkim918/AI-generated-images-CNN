2. Python
3. Code is contained in a singular Jupyter Notebook file called "classifier.ipynb"
4. This code can be run anywhere a Jupyter Notebook file can (Google colab, VS Code, etc.). The only constraint is that the code assumes that the data folder is in the same directory as the code file. I personally used VS Code, since I knew it would maintain the directory structure correctly. In VS Code, you may have to download Python and/or Jupyter Notebook extensions to run the code. I also had to use pip install for some of the import packages. Please email me at sgkim918@gmail.com if there are any issues.
