The resources included in this folder were used as a reference for the proper code structure and setup for a CNN (the CSCI470 resource) and for how to import the data set (the kaggle resource). I then tweaked parameters and layers using skills learned in this course until an acceptably accurate model was found. No other resources (except for course-provided lecture materials) were used for the generation of code.
